# Editor Support

Improve your development experience with features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

---

Tailwind provides an [extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense), which enables advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

You can [install it via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).

Add the following configuration to your `.vscode/settings.json` file, so that Tailwind directives have proper autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting:

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
"files.associations": {
    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
},
"editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "strings": true
}
```

If you use pnpm, make sure that tailwindcss is installed in your top level node_modules folder.
